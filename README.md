# Ultrasound extension
The Ultrasound extension for 3D Slicer contains modules to process ultrasound video data. Suggestions and contributions are welcome!

## Anonymize Ultrasound
This module reads a folder of ultrasound cine loops in DICOM format and iterates through them. It allows masking the fan shaped or rectangular image area to erase non-ultrasound information from the images. It also allows associating labels to loops, so classification annotations can start during anonymization. The masked loops are exported in DICOM format. The exported DICOM files only contain a specific set of DICOM tags that do not contain any personal information about the patient.

### How to use Anonymize Ultrasound module
1. Select **Input folder** as the folder that contains all your DICOM files. They can be in subfolders.
1. Select **Output folder** as an empty folder, or which contains previously exported files using this module.
1. Click **Read DICOM folder** and wait until the input and output folders are scanned to compile a list of files to be anonymized.
1. Click **Load next** to load the next DICOM file in alphabetical order.
1. Click **Define mask** and click on the four corners of the ultrasound area. Corner points can be modified later by dragging.
1. Click **Export** to produce three files in the output folder: the anonymized DICOM, an annotation file with the corner points, and a json file with all the original DICOM tags that went through light anonymization.

### Anonymization steps
- The area outside the defined fan or rectangle region is erased on all frames.
- A PatientUID is generated as a 10-digit hash of the input DICOM Patient ID, and a FileUID is generated as an 8-digit hash of the DICOM SOP Intance UID.
- The exported output file will be named **PatientUID_FileUID.dcm**
- When **Hash Patient ID** is selected, the patient name is replaced the PatientUID and the Series Description is replaced by PatientUID_FileUID.
- New SOP Series UID is generated for every exported file (cine loop) so all DICOM browsers can load them one-by-one. (Most DICOM browsers load all instances of a series at a time, but some ultrasound machines export all cine loops of an exam under a single series UID.)

Options under Settings collapsible button:
- **Skip single-frame input files**: use this for efficiency if you only need to export multi-frame DICOM files.
- **Skip input if output already exists**: prevents repeated loading of files whose output already exists.
- **Keep input folders and filenames in output folder**: keeps the subfolder structure and file names of input files.
- **Convert color to grayscale**: use this if you want to eliminate colors in the exported images.
- **JPEG compression in DICOM**: use this to apply compression in exported files without visual information loss.
- **Labels file**: Select a CSV file that contains classification labels. These labels will populate the GUI with checkboxes. Checked labels will be saved in the exported annotation json files.

## M-mode Analysis
This module generates an M-mode image from a B-mode loop along a user-specified line (see [US types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ultrasound#Types)). The line can be arbitrary, not just ultrasound scan lines. Measurements on the M-mode image can be saved.

### How to use Mmode Analysis module
1. Select **Output folder** where exported files will be saved.
1. Click **Scanline** to add a line markup on the B-mode image.
1. Click **Generate M-mode image** to generate the M-mode ultrasound in the lower view.
1. Optionally click **Measurement line** to add a ruler on the M-mode image.
1. Click **Save M-mode image** to export both the current B-mode image and the M-mode image with their lines. And the measurement in a CSV file in the output folder.
2.

## Time Series Annotation
This module facilitates the process of creating segmentations for time-series 2D images (ultrasound) and saving segmentations into an output sequence browser.

### How to use Time Series Annotation module
1. Prepare a Slicer scene with a recorded sequence browser with image frames and optionally tracking (transform) data, registered CT or MRI, ultrasound beam surface model, etc. Althernatively, use the 'Load sample data' button.
1. Make selection in the module's Inputs section.
1. Use the Segmentation section to create segmentations for frames.
1. Keyboard shortcuts facilitate the workflow: C saves current frame, S skips current frame without saving, D erases current segmentation, A shows/hides foreground volume.

## VS Code Development
### Auto-completion and analysis settings
To develop the Ultrasound extension, it is recommended to use Visual Studio Code with the Python extension. 
The following settings are suggested for the `settings.json` file in the `.vscode` folder of your Slicer extension development workspace:
```json
{
    "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "/Applications/Slicer.app/Contents/bin/PythonSlicer",
    "python.terminal.activateEnvironment": false,
    "python.autoComplete.extraPaths": [
        "/Applications/Slicer.app/Contents/lib/Slicer-5.8/qt-scripted-modules",
        "/Applications/Slicer.app/Contents/lib/Slicer-5.8/qt-loadable-modules",
        "/Applications/Slicer.app/Contents/lib/Python/lib/python3.9/site-packages",
    ],
    "python.analysis.extraPaths": [
        "/Applications/Slicer.app/Contents/lib/Slicer-5.8/qt-scripted-modules",
        "/Applications/Slicer.app/Contents/lib/Slicer-5.8/qt-loadable-modules",
        "/Applications/Slicer.app/Contents/lib/Python/lib/python3.9/site-packages",
    ]
}
```
This configuration allows you to use the Slicer Python interpreter and access the Slicer modules and libraries directly from VS Code.

### Debugging
Setup a `launch.json` file in the `.vscode` folder of your Slicer extension development workspace to enable debugging.
The following configuration allows you to attach the debugger to a running Slicer instance:
```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Python: Remote Attach",
            "type": "debugpy",
            "request": "attach",
            "connect": {
                "port": 5678,
                "host": "localhost"
            },
            "justMyCode": false,
            "pathMappings": [
                {
                    "localRoot": "${workspaceFolder}",
                    "remoteRoot": "${workspaceFolder}"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Step to attach the debugger:
1. Start Slicer App
2. Open the Python Interactor in Slicer and run the following command to start the debug server:
   ```python

   import debugpy
   debugpy.listen(("localhost", 5678))
   print("Waiting for debugger attach...")
   debugpy.wait_for_client()
   debugpy.breakpoint()
   ```
3. In VS Code, open the Debug panel and select the "Python: Remote Attach" configuration.
4. Click the green play button to start debugging.
5. You can now set breakpoints in your Python code and debug the Ultrasound extension as it runs in Slicer.
